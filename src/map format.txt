For now, all maps must have at least 2 citizens. The first citizen is automatically colorified. 
If there are no citizens, then the code that colorfies the first citizen crashes.
If there is only 1 citizen, then the game starts out at 100% progress and is considered an instant victory.

For story-mode levels, only add citizens that will be NEW for that level. The citizens from the previous level will
(eventually) be automatically carried over from the previous level.

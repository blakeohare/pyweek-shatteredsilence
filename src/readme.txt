Shattered Silence

Created for PyWeek 12 - "Nine Times" challenge
http://www.pyweek.org

This entry was written in Python. It requires Python (tested with 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1) and PyGame 1.9 to play (1.8 will not work).

If you are running windows, you may use the included ShatteredSilence.exe instead. It will work (like magic) without Python installed at all.
